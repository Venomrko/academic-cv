## About Me

My academic research centers on Natural Language Processing (NLP), driven by the belief that language fundamentally shapes human cognition and intelligence. A formative experience with Microsoft Xiaoice ignited my commitment to this field, revealing its profound potential. I approach research proactively, guided by the philosophy: "If I think about it, I will do it," translating theoretical insights into tangible progress. This action-oriented mindset, combined with a personal passion for adventure and embracing the unknown, fuels my pursuit of innovative solutions and a deeper understanding of language within the realm of artificial intelligence.
